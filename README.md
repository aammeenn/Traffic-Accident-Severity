# Traffic-Accident-Severity

This is a study on machine learning modeling of traffic accident data.
The focus of this study is to tackle the imbalance problem of traffic accident data by sampling techniques. Random oversampling, undersampling and SMOTE oversampling are applied with CART, Random Forest, and One-Class SVM, benchmarked with Logistic Regression. Variable importance rankings on the methods are obtained to identify key factors.
To further investigate the marginal effect of key factors, Partial Dependence Plots are applied for visualization, which implies certain policy indications.
